# Refined Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Documentation
- Write clear, comprehensive documentation for all components, functions, and complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Keep documentation up-to-date as code changes.

## 2. Code Structure
- Follow NextJS and React best practices for project structure and component organization.
- Use functional components and hooks instead of class components when possible.
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance.

## 3. Performance
- Optimize component rendering by using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate.
- Implement efficient state management using React hooks or libraries like Redux.
- Use server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) features of NextJS when applicable.

## 4. Theme Configuration
- Implement a centralized theme configuration for consistent styling across the application.
- Use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or Emotion for better theme management.
- Implement a dark theme option using CSS variables or a theming system.

## 5. Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations and provide meaningful error messages.
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## 6. Security
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and API keys.
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web application security.

## 7. Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure for better accessibility.
- Implement keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary to improve screen reader compatibility.

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests for components and utility functions.
- Implement integration tests for complex user flows.
- Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for testing React components.

## 9. Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format.
- Create feature branches for new development and use pull requests for code reviews.
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable at all times.

## 10. Code Quality
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and to catch potential issues.
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.
- Refactor code regularly to improve readability and maintainability.
